# Sentimenti
Sentiment Analysis IOS-app
## What it does
Sentimenti app has a model that was trained on hundreds of tweets that contained people's sentiments. Model classifies each statement as positive, negative or neutral using Natural Language Processing. With Sentimenti, you can get to know what other people think about whatever you ask! 
## How I built it
I used Xcode as IDE for making my IOS-app, SwiftUI framework for building user interface for the app, NaturalLanguage and CoreML frameworks for building, training and testing my Machine Learning Model.
